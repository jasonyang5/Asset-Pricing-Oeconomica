# Installation, Basic Computer Concepts

## Installation- R, RStudio, Tidyverse
For this quarter, we will be using R and its associated IDE (Integrated Developing Environment, or a very fancy text editor) RStudio. 

Here's how you install:
(insert installation directions)

R-Base is quite garbage at getting things done. The syntax is not consistent, it's very slow, and you have to implement everything yourself. So, we will be using the package "tidyverse" instead. 
Open RStudio and in the console (bottom left) run the following code:
```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## Path and Working Directory
If you have taken CS151, you can skip this section.

Items in your computer are stored in a series of folders, usually starting somewhere in the C Drive if you use windows. 

## Github
We will use Github to share lecture notes, skeleton code for assignments, and solutions. 

(can windows use Github without installing CygWin?)
